# Task ID: 20
# Title: Develop End-to-End Testing Suite
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 5, 10, 12, 13
# Priority: low
# Description: Create a comprehensive end-to-end testing suite to validate the entire system from data collection to model evaluation.
# Details:
1. Create an `e2e_tests` directory with test scenarios
2. Implement end-to-end test cases:
   - Data collection from a simple test site
   - Processing pipeline with minimal data
   - Dataset building with test data
   - Mini fine-tuning with small model
   - Evaluation on subset of benchmarks
3. Add CI integration for periodic full system testing
4. Implement performance benchmarking
5. Create test reporting and visualization

Example test case:
```python
def test_youtube_workflow_to_model():
    # 1. Run orchestration for YouTube workflow
    orchestrator = Orchestrator()
    results = orchestrator.run_workflow(
        site="youtube",
        workflow=YOUTUBE_TEST_WORKFLOW,
        sessions=1
    )
    
    # 2. Process collected data
    processor = Processor()
    processor.process_data(results.session_id)
    
    # 3. Build mini dataset
    builder = DatasetBuilder()
    dataset_path = builder.build_dataset(
        input_path=f"s3://checkpoints/{results.session_id}/",
        output_path="./test_datasets/"
    )
    
    # 4. Run mini fine-tune
    trainer = LoRATrainer()
    model_path = trainer.train(
        model_name="Qwen/Qwen2-7B",
        dataset_path=dataset_path,
        epochs=1
    )
    
    # 5. Run mini eval
    evaluator = Evaluator()
    eval_results = evaluator.evaluate(model_path)
    
    # Verify results
    assert eval_results.success_rate > 0.5
```

# Test Strategy:
Run end-to-end tests in isolated environment. Test with minimal configuration to validate core functionality. Measure end-to-end execution time and resource usage. Verify all components integrate correctly.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Test Directory Structure [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up a test directory structure that mirrors the application code organization
### Details:
Establish folders for models, services, and controllers tests that reflect the application's architecture. Include separate directories for unit, integration, and end-to-end tests to maintain clarity and organization.

## 2. Define End-to-End Test Scenarios [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.1
### Description: Identify and document all critical end-to-end test scenarios across system components
### Details:
Create comprehensive test scenarios that cover the full workflow of the application. Document expected inputs, outputs, and system behaviors for each scenario to ensure thorough coverage.

## 3. Implement Automated Test Suite [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.2
### Description: Develop automated tests for all identified end-to-end scenarios
### Details:
Write automated test scripts using appropriate testing frameworks. Include unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests to validate code changes and identify defects promptly.

## 4. Set Up CI Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.3
### Description: Configure continuous integration pipeline to run tests automatically
### Details:
Integrate the test suite with CI tools to automatically run tests on code changes. Configure the pipeline to run appropriate test subsets based on the type of code change to optimize execution time.

## 5. Implement Performance Benchmarking [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.3
### Description: Create performance tests and establish baseline metrics
### Details:
Develop performance tests to measure response times, throughput, and resource utilization. Establish baseline metrics for comparison and set acceptable thresholds for performance degradation.

## 6. Develop Test Reporting System [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.4, 20.5
### Description: Create a comprehensive test reporting dashboard
### Details:
Implement a reporting system that displays test results, coverage metrics, and performance benchmarks. Include trend analysis to track quality improvements over time.

## 7. Set Up Environment Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.1
### Description: Configure separate DEV, QA, and PROD environments with appropriate access controls
### Details:
Establish separate environments with distinct file systems and disk quotas. Implement appropriate security measures with DEV being most open, and QA/PROD having increasingly restricted access.

## 8. Create Test Migration Process [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.6, 20.7
### Description: Establish a process for migrating tests between environments
### Details:
Develop procedures for promoting tests from DEV to QA to PROD environments. Include validation steps to ensure tests function correctly in each environment before promotion.
