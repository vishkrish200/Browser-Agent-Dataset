In `src/browserbase_client/client.py`:\n   - Modified the `BrowserbaseClient` class to accept an `api_key` parameter in its constructor\n   - Added initialization of the `ApiKeyAuth` strategy with the provided API key\n   - Implemented a helper method `_get_headers()` that constructs request headers with the authentication information\n   - This helper will be used by all API methods to ensure consistent authentication\n\n3. In `src/browserbase_client/__init__.py`:\n   - Exported the necessary classes: `BrowserbaseClient`, `ApiKeyAuth`, and `AuthStrategy`\n   - This ensures these classes are available when importing the package\n\nThe authentication implementation is now complete for the API key method, which is the primary authentication mechanism for Browserbase.

Ensure errors are logged and surfaced appropriately.\n\nThe error handling implementation consists of a base custom exception class `BrowserbaseAPIError` defined in `src/browserbase_client/exceptions.py`. This exception captures essential information including error messages, HTTP status codes, and response content, providing comprehensive context for debugging.\n\nThe client's `_request` method in `src/browserbase_client/client.py` implements error handling by catching both `httpx.HTTPStatusError` (for 4xx/5xx API errors) and `httpx.RequestError` (for network/request issues), then re-raising them as `BrowserbaseAPIError` with preserved details.\n\nRather than implementing multiple specialized exception types at this stage, we're using a single exception class with attributes that allow users to differentiate between error types (via `status_code`). More granular exception classes can be added later if specific use cases demonstrate a need.\n\nFor retry logic, we've decided to defer implementation of built-in retry mechanisms. Instead, users can implement custom retry strategies by catching `BrowserbaseAPIError` and examining its attributes. This approach maintains simplicity while providing flexibility.\n\nError surfacing is handled through the comprehensive information contained in `BrowserbaseAPIError`. Actual logging implementation will be addressed in the upcoming Logging subtask (2.6).\n</info added on 2025-05-11T11:13:09.729Z>",

Implement key log points:\n   - Client initialization in BrowserbaseClient.__init__\n   - Request attempts, successful responses, and error details in _request method\n\nThe logging system has been implemented according to the plan. The standard Python logging module was imported in client.py and a module-level logger was initialized using logging.getLogger(__name__). Client initialization is now logged at INFO level, capturing the base URL being used. The _request method logs detailed information about requests at DEBUG level (method, URL, payload) and responses (status code, truncated response text). Error handling was enhanced with logger.error() calls that include stack traces (exc_info=True) when HTTP status errors or request errors occur, before wrapping them in BrowserbaseAPIError.\n\nThe implementation follows best practices by not setting handlers or specific log levels within the library, allowing consuming applications to configure the browserbase_client logger according to their needs. Sensitive data protection is handled by not logging the full header dictionary that contains the API key. The current implementation logs payloads as-is since the known session creation parameters don't contain highly sensitive data beyond potential user-defined metadata. This provides a good balance between useful debugging information and security considerations.\n</info added on 2025-05-11T11:15:22.260Z>",

Create a dedicated `config.py` module to centralize configuration management\n   - Define environment variable constants (BROWSERBASE_API_KEY_ENV_VAR, BROWSERBASE_BASE_URL_ENV_VAR, BROWSERBASE_DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS_ENV_VAR)\n   - Set default values (DEFAULT_BASE_URL = \"https://api.browserbase.com/v1\", DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS = 30.0)\n\n2. Implement getter functions in `config.py` to resolve configuration values:\n   - `get_api_key()`: Prioritize programmatic override, then environment variable\n   - `get_base_url()`: Prioritize override, then environment variable, then default value\n   - `get_default_timeout_seconds()`: Similar priority chain with type conversion and error handling\n\n3. Update `BrowserbaseClient.__init__` in `client.py`:\n   - Make all configuration parameters optional with default None\n   - Use getter functions to resolve actual values\n   - Implement validation (raise ValueError if API key is missing)\n   - Update auth strategy with resolved API key\n\n4. Apply timeout configuration in the `_request` method:\n   - Pass the resolved timeout value to httpx.AsyncClient\n\n5. For initial implementation, focus on environment variables and programmatic overrides\n   - Defer dedicated config file support for a future enhancement\n\n6. Update package exports in `__init__.py` to expose relevant configuration constants\n</info added on 2025-05-11T11:16:27.191Z>\n<info added on 2025-05-11T11:17:48.317Z>\nThe implementation of the configuration system has been completed successfully. The system provides a flexible way to manage API endpoints, credentials, timeouts, and other runtime options through a combination of programmatic configuration, environment variables, and default values.\n\nKey components implemented:\n\n1. Created `src/browserbase_client/config.py` module that centralizes configuration management:\n   - Defined constants for environment variable names (BROWSERBASE_API_KEY_ENV_VAR, BROWSERBASE_BASE_URL_ENV_VAR, BROWSERBASE_DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS_ENV_VAR)\n   - Established default values (DEFAULT_BASE_URL = \"https://api.browserbase.com/v1\", DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS = 30.0)\n   - Implemented getter functions with priority resolution logic:\n     - `get_api_key()`: Resolves API key from constructor argument, then environment variable\n     - `get_base_url()`: Resolves base URL from constructor argument, then environment variable, then default value\n     - `get_default_timeout_seconds()`: Resolves timeout with similar priority chain, including type conversion and error handling\n\n2. Updated `src/browserbase_client/client.py`:\n   - Modified `BrowserbaseClient.__init__` to accept optional parameters (api_key, base_url, timeout_seconds)\n   - Integrated the getter functions from config.py to resolve configuration values\n   - Added validation to raise ValueError if API key is missing after resolution attempts\n   - Enhanced the `_request` method to use the resolved timeout value with httpx.AsyncClient\n\n3. Updated `src/browserbase_client/__init__.py` to export the public configuration constants, making them accessible to library users\n\nThe configuration system now provides a clean, hierarchical approach to configuration with clear precedence rules: constructor arguments take highest priority, followed by environment variables, and finally default values. This gives users multiple convenient ways to configure the client according to their specific needs and environment.\n</info added on 2025-05-11T11:17:48.317Z>",

Package Exports (src/stagehand_client/__init__.py):\n   - Update to export WorkflowBuilder and relevant types\n\nThis implementation will provide a clean, type-safe API for defining workflows programmatically with a fluent interface, while maintaining compatibility with the Stagehand API endpoints.\n</info added on 2025-05-11T12:07:20.190Z>\n<info added on 2025-05-11T12:09:02.022Z>\nImplementation progress update on the Task and Workflow Creation component:\n\nThe core functionality for task and workflow creation has been implemented according to the plan. The implementation includes:\n\n1. Type System Implementation:\n   - Successfully defined `WorkflowAction` as a Literal type with all required actions: \"navigate\", \"click\", \"type_text\", \"wait_for_selector\", \"scroll_to_element\", \"get_text\", and \"get_attribute\"\n   - Created the `WorkflowStep` TypedDict with all necessary fields including action, selector, text, url, attribute_name, and timeout_ms with appropriate optionality\n\n2. Workflow Builder Implementation:\n   - Completed the `WorkflowBuilder` class in workflow.py\n   - Implemented fluent interface methods for all action types, allowing for chainable method calls\n   - Added the `build()` method that returns the complete workflow definition as a dictionary ready for API submission\n\n3. Client Integration:\n   - Added the placeholder `create_task` method to the `StagehandClient` class with the signature:\n     ```python\n     async def create_task(self, workflow_data: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]\n     ```\n   - This method is ready to be connected to the API endpoint in the next phase\n\n4. Package Exports:\n   - Updated `__init__.py` to properly export `WorkflowBuilder`, `WorkflowAction`, and `WorkflowStep` types\n   - This ensures users can import these components directly from the package root\n\nThe implementation provides a clean, type-safe API for programmatically defining workflows with a fluent interface. Users can now create workflow definitions that are compatible with the Stagehand API endpoints.\n\nNext steps:\n- Complete the implementation of the `create_task` method to connect with the API\n- Add validation for workflow definitions\n- Create comprehensive examples and documentation\n- Implement unit tests for the workflow builder\n</info added on 2025-05-11T12:09:02.022Z>",

Implement resource usage tracking and metrics collection. Create cleanup mechanisms with graceful shutdown. Implement resource allocation strategies with prioritization. Design resource throttling and quota enforcement mechanisms.\n\nFor the MVP implementation, we've identified that the primary resource requiring management is the Browserbase session. The current Orchestrator implementation already handles the essential resource lifecycle:\n\n1. Allocation: The `_create_browserbase_session` method successfully handles session creation.\n2. Tracking: Active sessions are tracked in the `_active_sessions` dictionary within the Orchestrator class, with proper lock management to ensure thread safety.\n3. Cleanup: The `_release_browserbase_session` method is called reliably for all successfully created sessions within the `finally` block of the `run_workflow` method, ensuring proper resource cleanup.\n\nThis implementation covers the core requirements for the MVP. The more advanced features originally specified (connection pooling, detailed metrics collection, throttling mechanisms, and quota enforcement) have been deferred as they are not necessary for the initial release. No additional code changes are needed for this subtask at this time.\n</info added on 2025-05-12T18:47:08.104Z>",

Command-Specific Logging:\n   - Add logger instances in command modules (`configure_cli.py`, `collect_cli.py`) using `logging.getLogger(__name__)`\n   - Replace appropriate `print()` statements with proper log level calls (`logger.info()`, `logger.debug()`, etc.)\n   - Ensure consistent log message formatting across all modules\n\n3. User Feedback Strategy:\n   - Maintain `typer.echo()` for direct user-facing output\n   - Use `logger.error()`/`logger.exception()` for error conditions\n   - Complement error logging with `typer.secho()` for highlighted user feedback\n   - Ensure clear separation between diagnostic logs and user interface elements\n\n4. Testing Approach:\n   - Create tests in existing test files or a new `test_logging.py`\n   - Utilize pytest's `caplog` fixture to verify log output\n   - Validate that `LOG_LEVEL` setting properly controls log verbosity\n   - Test error conditions to ensure proper logging and user feedback\n\n5.
