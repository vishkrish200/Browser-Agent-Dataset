# Task ID: 13
# Title: Implement Evaluation Harness
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 12
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop an evaluation system that runs WebArena and Mind2Web benchmarks to validate model performance.
# Details:
1. Create an `eval` directory with evaluation modules
2. Implement Docker Compose setup:
   - vLLM server configuration
   - WebArena runner configuration
   - Mind2Web runner configuration
3. Create evaluation scripts:
   - `run_webarena.py`
   - `run_mind2web.py`
   - `run_all_benchmarks.py`
4. Implement result collection and reporting
5. Add visualization of performance metrics

Example usage:
```bash
# Run Mind2Web evaluation
python -m browser_agent_dataset.eval.run_mind2web --model-path ./checkpoints/lora-adapter

# Run all benchmarks
python -m browser_agent_dataset.eval.run_all_benchmarks --model-path ./checkpoints/lora-adapter
```

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for evaluation logic. Integration test with small benchmark subset. Test Docker Compose setup in CI environment. Verify metrics calculation and reporting accuracy.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up evaluation module framework [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the base structure for the evaluation module including directory organization and dependency management
### Details:
Create a directory structure for the evaluation module, initialize version control, and set up a requirements.txt or package.json file for dependencies. Define the module's API and interfaces that will be used by other components.

## 2. Create Docker Compose configuration [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.1
### Description: Develop a Docker Compose file that orchestrates all necessary services for benchmarking
### Details:
Create a docker-compose.yml file that defines services for benchmarking, database for results, and any supporting services. Use environment variables for configuration and follow best practices like grouping by category and avoiding hardcoded values.

## 3. Implement benchmark scripts [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.1
### Description: Develop scripts to run various benchmarks against the system under test
### Details:
Create modular benchmark scripts that can test different aspects of the system. Include parameters for configuring test duration, load intensity, and other relevant factors. Ensure scripts can be run independently or as part of the larger evaluation framework.

## 4. Build result collection mechanism [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.2, 13.3
### Description: Create a system to collect and store benchmark results in a structured format
### Details:
Implement a data collection layer that captures benchmark metrics and stores them in a database or structured files. Include timestamps, test parameters, and system configuration details with each result set.

## 5. Develop reporting functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.4
### Description: Create reports that summarize benchmark results in a readable format
### Details:
Build reporting tools that can generate summaries of benchmark results, including statistical analysis, comparisons between runs, and highlighting of significant findings. Support multiple output formats like JSON, CSV, and HTML.

## 6. Implement visualization components [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.5
### Description: Create visual representations of benchmark results using charts and graphs
### Details:
Develop visualization components that can render benchmark results as charts, graphs, and other visual formats. Include interactive elements where appropriate and ensure visualizations are clear and informative.

## 7. Create integration tests [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.3, 13.4, 13.5, 13.6
### Description: Develop tests to verify the correct operation of the evaluation module components
### Details:
Write integration tests that verify the evaluation module works correctly end-to-end. Include tests for benchmark execution, result collection, reporting, and visualization components. Ensure tests can be run in isolation and as part of a test suite.

## 8. Document the evaluation module [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.7
### Description: Create comprehensive documentation for setup, usage, and extension of the evaluation module
### Details:
Write documentation covering installation, configuration, usage examples, and extension points. Include troubleshooting guides and best practices for running benchmarks. Ensure documentation is clear, accurate, and accessible to both technical and non-technical users.
