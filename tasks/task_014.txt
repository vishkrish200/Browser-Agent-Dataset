# Task ID: 14
# Title: Setup CI/CD Pipeline
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: low
# Description: Configure GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment, including linting, testing, and nightly jobs.
# Details:
1. Create `.github/workflows` directory with workflow definitions
2. Implement CI workflow:
   - Linting with flake8/black
   - Unit tests with pytest
   - Coverage reporting
3. Implement nightly workflow:
   - Smoke-crawl test with minimal configuration
   - Mini LoRA sanity-train on small dataset
4. Add deployment workflow for documentation
5. Configure CloudWatch integration for error alerts
6. Setup dependency scanning and security checks

Example workflow file:
```yaml
name: CI
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  lint:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: '3.10'
      - run: pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
      - run: flake8 src tests
      - run: black --check src tests
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: '3.10'
      - run: pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
      - run: pytest tests/
```

# Test Strategy:
Verify CI/CD pipeline runs successfully on test commits. Test nightly workflow with minimal configuration. Ensure error reporting works correctly. Test security scanning with known vulnerable dependencies.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set Up Workflow Directory Structure [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create and organize the directory structure for storing workflow configuration files, ensuring clear separation for CI, nightly, deployment, monitoring, and security workflows.
### Details:
Establish a standardized directory (e.g., .github/workflows or equivalent) and subfolders as needed for each workflow type to promote maintainability and clarity.

## 2. Implement Continuous Integration (CI) Workflow [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.1
### Description: Develop and configure the CI workflow to automate code builds, testing, and integration checks on every code commit or pull request.
### Details:
Set up CI pipeline using tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or GitLab CI to ensure code quality and early bug detection through automated testing and linting.

## 3. Configure Nightly Workflow [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.1
### Description: Create a scheduled workflow that runs nightly to perform tasks such as full test suites, static analysis, or database consistency checks.
### Details:
Schedule the workflow to trigger at a specified time each night, ensuring comprehensive checks that may be too resource-intensive for every commit.

## 4. Develop Deployment Workflow [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.2, 14.3
### Description: Set up an automated deployment workflow to handle application releases to staging and production environments.
### Details:
Automate deployment steps, including artifact building, environment provisioning, and post-deployment verification, ensuring repeatable and reliable releases.

## 5. Integrate Monitoring into Workflows [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.4
### Description: Incorporate monitoring tools and alerting mechanisms into the workflows to track application health, performance, and workflow execution status.
### Details:
Integrate with tools like Prometheus, ELK stack, or cloud-native monitoring solutions to provide visibility and enable rapid response to issues.

## 6. Implement Security Checks in Workflows [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.2, 14.4
### Description: Add automated security scanning and compliance checks to the CI/CD pipelines to detect vulnerabilities and enforce security best practices.
### Details:
Integrate tools for static code analysis, dependency vulnerability scanning, and secret detection to ensure security is embedded throughout the development lifecycle.
