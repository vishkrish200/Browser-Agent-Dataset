# Task ID: 6
# Title: Develop PII Scrubbing Component
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a component to identify and remove personally identifiable information (PII) from collected HTML and action data.
# Details:
1. Create a `pii_scrubber.py` module with PIIScrubber class
2. Implement detection and scrubbing for common PII types:
   - Email addresses
   - Phone numbers
   - Names (using NER)
   - Addresses
   - Account numbers
   - Session tokens and cookies
3. Add configuration for scrubbing levels (strict vs. permissive)
4. Implement HTML-aware scrubbing that preserves DOM structure
5. Add logging for scrubbed items (counts only, not values)

Example usage:
```python
from pii_scrubber import PIIScrubber

scrubber = PIIScrubber(mode="strict")
clean_html = scrubber.clean_html(raw_html)
clean_action = scrubber.clean_action_data(action_data)
```

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests with synthetic data containing various PII patterns. Test HTML structure preservation after scrubbing. Benchmark performance on large HTML documents. Verify no PII leaks through in edge cases.
