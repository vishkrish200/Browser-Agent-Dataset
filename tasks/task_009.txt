# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement CLI Interface
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 5, 6, 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a command-line interface for running data collection, processing, and dataset building tasks.
# Details:
1. Create a `cli.py` module using Click or Typer
2. Implement commands for:
   - `collector run --site SITE --workflow WORKFLOW` - Run data collection
   - `processor run --job JOB_TYPE` - Run processing jobs
   - `dataset build` - Build JSONL datasets
   - `eval run --benchmark BENCHMARK` - Run evaluations
3. Add configuration options for all commands
4. Implement progress bars and rich terminal output
5. Add logging configuration
6. Create help documentation for all commands

Example usage:
```bash
# Run data collection
python -m browser_agent_dataset.cli collector run --site youtube --workflow video_discovery_v1 --sessions 5

# Build dataset
python -m browser_agent_dataset.cli dataset build --output train.jsonl
```

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for CLI argument parsing and command routing. Integration tests for each command with minimal configurations. Test help output and error handling. Verify logging works correctly at different verbosity levels.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design CLI Structure and Command Framework [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define the overall CLI architecture, command structure, and establish conventions for command naming and organization.
### Details:
Create a blueprint for CLI organization with resources and aliases. Follow established CLI conventions. Plan for human-readable output with JSON support for automation. Consider future extensibility.

## 2. Implement Core Scaffolding Functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Develop the primary scaffolding engine that will generate project templates and code structures.
### Details:
Build the core template generation system. Create standard templates for common components. Implement template variable substitution. Ensure templates follow best practices and are easily customizable.

## 3. Develop Configuration Management System [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Create a robust configuration system that handles user preferences, project settings, and template customization options.
### Details:
Implement configuration file loading/saving. Support for multiple configuration formats. Create sensible defaults. Allow for project-specific and global configurations.

## 4. Build Progress Tracking and Logging System [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Implement comprehensive logging and progress reporting for CLI operations.
### Details:
Create a logging system with multiple verbosity levels. Implement progress indicators for long-running tasks. Design error reporting that fails noisily and as early as possible. Support both human-readable and machine-parseable output formats.

## 5. Create Comprehensive Help Documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.2, 9.3
### Description: Develop in-tool help documentation and usage guides for all commands and options.
### Details:
Document all public flags and options. Create command-specific help text. Implement examples for common use cases. Ensure help text follows consistent formatting and style.

## 6. Implement Testing Framework [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.2, 9.3, 9.4
### Description: Develop comprehensive testing infrastructure for CLI functionality and generated code.
### Details:
Create unit tests for core functionality. Implement integration tests for end-to-end workflows. Develop validation tests for generated code. Set up CI integration for automated testing.

## 7. Finalize CLI Implementation and Documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.2, 9.3, 9.4, 9.5, 9.6
### Description: Complete the CLI implementation, perform final testing, and prepare comprehensive external documentation.
### Details:
Conduct final review of all commands and options. Ensure proper exit codes are used. Verify all error handling. Create external documentation including README, installation guide, and advanced usage examples.
