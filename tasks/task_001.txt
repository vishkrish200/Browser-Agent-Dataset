# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Project Repository and Environment
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the project repository with basic structure, documentation, and environment configuration for the Browser-Agent Dataset MVP.
# Details:
1. Create GitHub repository with appropriate license (MIT recommended)
2. Setup basic directory structure:
   - `/src` - Core code
   - `/config` - Configuration files
   - `/scripts` - Utility scripts
   - `/docs` - Documentation
   - `/tests` - Test suite
3. Create initial README.md with project overview, installation instructions
4. Setup .env template for Browserbase and Stagehand API keys
5. Configure .gitignore for Python, environment files, etc.
6. Setup requirements.txt with initial dependencies
7. Create basic CI/CD GitHub Actions workflow for linting and testing

# Test Strategy:
Verify repository structure is complete, environment variables load correctly, and CI/CD pipeline runs successfully on initial commit.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create basic CI/CD GitHub Actions workflow [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up a GitHub Actions workflow for linting and basic testing of the Python code.
### Details:
1. Create .github/workflows directory.
2. Define a main.yml (or similar) workflow file.
3. Configure the workflow to trigger on push/pull_request to the main branch.
4. Add steps to checkout code, set up Python.
5. Add a linting step (e.g., using Flake8 or Pylint).
6. Add a basic testing step (e.g., running pytest, initially with minimal tests).

1. Create .github/workflows directory.
2. Define a main.yml (or similar) workflow file.
3. Configure the workflow to trigger on push/pull_request to the main branch.
4. Add steps to checkout code, set up Python.
5. Add a linting step (e.g., using Flake8 or Pylint).
6. Add a basic testing step (e.g., running pytest, initially with minimal tests).

Implementation Plan:
1. Create the directory `.github/workflows`.
2. Create a file named `main.yml` inside `.github/workflows`.
3. The content of `main.yml` will be:
   * `name: Python CI`
   * Trigger on `push` to `main` and `pull_request` to `main`.
   * Define a job named `build`.
   * Runs on `ubuntu-latest`.
   * Steps:
     * Checkout code: `actions/checkout@v4` (using v4 as it's current).
     * Set up Python: `actions/setup-python@v4` (using v4) with Python version 3.10.
     * Install dependencies: `pip install flake8 pytest` and then `pip install -r requirements.txt`. (Separating linter/tester install from project dependencies for clarity).
     * Linting: `flake8 . --count --select=E9,F63,F7,F82 --show-source --statistics` (using a slightly more verbose flake8 command for better output).
     * Testing: `pytest`.

The GitHub Actions workflow file has been successfully created and configured. The implementation includes:

1. Created `.github/workflows` directory in the repository.
2. Created `main.yml` workflow file with the following configuration:
   - Workflow named "Python CI"
   - Triggers on push and pull requests to the main branch
   - Runs on ubuntu-latest
   - Steps include:
     - Code checkout using actions/checkout@v4
     - Python 3.10 setup using actions/setup-python@v4
     - Installation of dependencies (flake8, pytest, and project requirements)
     - Linting with flake8 using standard error checks
     - Running pytest for testing

The workflow is now operational but requires additional work to be fully effective:
1. Need to create actual test files in the repository
2. Need to ensure `requirements.txt` is properly populated with all project dependencies
3. Consider expanding the linting rules as the project grows
4. May need to adjust the Python version based on project requirements
