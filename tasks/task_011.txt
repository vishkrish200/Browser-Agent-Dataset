# Task ID: 11
# Title: Implement S3 Storage Integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a storage module for handling data storage and retrieval from S3, following the specified bucket structure.
# Details:
1. Create a `storage.py` module with StorageManager class
2. Implement methods for:
   - Uploading HTML, screenshots, and action data
   - Retrieving data by session_id and step_id
   - Listing available sessions and steps
   - Managing lifecycle policies
3. Add support for local filesystem fallback for development
4. Implement batched operations for efficiency
5. Add retry logic and error handling

Example usage:
```python
from storage import StorageManager

storage = StorageManager("s3://checkpoints/")
storage.store_step_data(
    session_id="session123",
    step_id="step456",
    html_content="<html>...</html>",
    screenshot_bytes=screenshot_data,
    action_data={"type": "click", "selector": "#button"}
)

html, screenshot, action = storage.retrieve_step_data("session123", "step456")
```

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for storage and retrieval operations with mocked S3. Integration test with actual S3 bucket (or LocalStack). Test error handling and retries. Verify data integrity through round-trip tests.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Module Setup and S3 Configuration [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Initialize the module, configure AWS credentials, and set up S3 bucket access, including local fallback configuration.
### Details:
Set up the project structure, install necessary dependencies (e.g., AWS SDK), and configure environment variables for S3 and local fallback. Ensure secure handling of credentials and provide configuration options for both S3 and local storage.

## 2. Upload Logic Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1
### Description: Develop logic to upload files to S3 with support for batching and fallback to local storage if S3 is unavailable.
### Details:
Implement file upload functions that can handle single and batched uploads. Integrate error detection to trigger fallback to local storage when S3 is unreachable or errors occur.

## 3. Download Logic Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1
### Description: Develop logic to download files from S3 or local storage, depending on availability and configuration.
### Details:
Implement file retrieval functions that prioritize S3 but can seamlessly switch to local storage if needed. Ensure efficient streaming and error handling.

## 4. Session and Step Listing [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.2, 11.3
### Description: Implement listing of available sessions and steps, supporting both S3 and local storage backends.
### Details:
Create functions to enumerate sessions and steps, abstracting the storage backend. Ensure consistent output regardless of storage location.

## 5. Lifecycle Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.2, 11.3, 11.4
### Description: Implement lifecycle management for uploaded files, including cleanup, expiration, and versioning support.
### Details:
Add logic to manage file lifecycles, such as automatic deletion after expiration, version control, and cleanup of obsolete files in both S3 and local storage.

## 6. Robust Error Handling and Logging [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.2, 11.3, 11.4, 11.5
### Description: Integrate comprehensive error handling and logging throughout all operations, including fallback and batching scenarios.
### Details:
Ensure all operations have try/catch blocks, meaningful error messages, and logging for debugging. Handle partial failures in batching and fallback gracefully.

## 7. Automated Testing and Validation [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.2, 11.3, 11.4, 11.5, 11.6
### Description: Develop and execute automated tests covering all features, including S3 integration, fallback, batching, and error scenarios.
### Details:
Write unit and integration tests for upload/download, listing, lifecycle management, fallback logic, and error handling. Validate correctness and robustness under various failure modes.
