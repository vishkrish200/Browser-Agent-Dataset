# Task ID: 19
# Title: Implement Data Quality Validation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 10
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a system to validate the quality of collected data and generated datasets.
# Details:
1. Create a `validation.py` module with validation utilities
2. Implement data quality checks:
   - HTML structure validation
   - Action data completeness
   - Screenshot quality assessment
   - PII detection in processed data
   - Token length validation
3. Add dataset statistics generation:
   - Action type distribution
   - Domain coverage
   - Step count per session
   - HTML size distribution
4. Implement validation reporting
5. Create data quality dashboard

Example usage:
```python
from validation import DataValidator

validator = DataValidator()
validation_results = validator.validate_dataset("./datasets/train.jsonl")
validator.generate_quality_report("./reports/quality_report.html")
```

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for validation logic with sample data. Test with intentionally corrupted data to verify detection. Verify statistics calculation accuracy. Test reporting with various dataset sizes.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set Up Validation Module Infrastructure [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Initialize the validation module by configuring the environment, dependencies, and integration points with the data pipeline.
### Details:
This includes setting up the engine or framework for validation, configuring necessary hooks, and ensuring the module can be invoked as part of the workflow.[5][3]

## 2. Implement Data Quality Checks [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.1
### Description: Develop and configure individual data quality checks such as type validation, range checks, null checks, and custom business rules.
### Details:
Define each validation rule and ensure they are modular and configurable for different datasets or requirements.[1][2][5]

## 3. Aggregate and Generate Validation Statistics [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.2
### Description: Collect results from all quality checks and compute summary statistics such as pass/fail counts, error rates, and distribution of issues.
### Details:
Implement logic to aggregate validation outcomes and generate metrics for reporting and monitoring.

## 4. Develop Reporting Mechanism [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.3
### Description: Create automated reports summarizing validation results, including detailed logs and summary statistics.
### Details:
Design report templates and ensure reports can be generated in required formats (e.g., PDF, HTML, CSV) for stakeholders.

## 5. Build Dashboard for Data Quality Monitoring [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.3
### Description: Develop a dashboard to visualize validation statistics and trends, enabling real-time monitoring and drill-down into specific issues.
### Details:
Integrate with reporting outputs and provide interactive elements for users to explore validation results.

## 6. Test Validation Module and Quality Checks [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.2
### Description: Design and execute test cases to verify the correctness and robustness of the validation module and each quality check.
### Details:
Include unit tests, integration tests, and edge case scenarios to ensure reliability and accuracy.

## 7. End-to-End System Validation and User Acceptance Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.4, 19.5, 19.6
### Description: Conduct comprehensive system testing, including user acceptance, to ensure the validation module, reporting, and dashboard meet requirements.
### Details:
Simulate real-world data flows, validate outputs, and gather feedback from stakeholders for final adjustments.
