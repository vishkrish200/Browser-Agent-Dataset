# Task ID: 15
# Title: Implement Error Handling and Monitoring
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a comprehensive error handling and monitoring system for the orchestration layer.
# Details:
1. Create a `monitoring.py` module with monitoring utilities
2. Implement error classification:
   - Browserbase-specific errors
   - Stagehand-specific errors
   - Network/infrastructure errors
   - Data processing errors
3. Add retry strategies for different error types
4. Implement CloudWatch integration for alerts
5. Create error reporting dashboard
6. Add performance monitoring for collection and processing

Example usage:
```python
from monitoring import ErrorHandler, Monitor

with ErrorHandler(max_retries=3, retry_delay=5):
    result = orchestrator.run_workflow(...)

monitor = Monitor()
monitor.track_collection_performance(session_count=5, duration_seconds=120)
monitor.report_error("browserbase_session_failed", details={"session_id": "xyz"})
```

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for error handling and retry logic. Test monitoring with simulated errors. Verify CloudWatch integration with test alerts. Test dashboard with sample data.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Define Monitoring Goals and Metrics [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Clearly define what needs to be monitored, why, and establish key metrics to track
### Details:
Identify critical components requiring monitoring, determine monitoring frequency, establish performance baselines, and define success criteria for system performance

## 2. Select and Install Monitoring Modules [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.1
### Description: Choose and implement appropriate monitoring tools and modules based on infrastructure requirements
### Details:
Research available monitoring solutions, install only relevant modules to minimize complexity, verify compatibility with existing systems, and document module versions

## 3. Implement Error Classification System [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.1
### Description: Develop a comprehensive error taxonomy and classification framework
### Details:
Create error categories (critical, warning, informational), define error codes, establish error severity levels, and document classification criteria for consistent error handling

## 4. Design Retry Strategies [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.3
### Description: Develop robust retry mechanisms for handling transient failures
### Details:
Implement exponential backoff algorithms, define maximum retry attempts, establish retry timeouts, and create circuit breaker patterns to prevent cascading failures

## 5. Configure Alert Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.2, 15.3
### Description: Set up alerting system with appropriate thresholds and notification channels
### Details:
Define alert thresholds based on metrics, configure notification channels (email, SMS, chat), implement alert prioritization, and create escalation procedures for unresolved issues

## 6. Create Monitoring Dashboards [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.2, 15.5
### Description: Design and implement comprehensive visualization dashboards for monitoring data
### Details:
Select key metrics for visualization, design intuitive dashboard layouts, implement real-time data updates, and create role-based dashboard views for different stakeholders

## 7. Implement Performance Monitoring [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.2
### Description: Set up comprehensive performance tracking across all system components
### Details:
Configure resource utilization monitoring (CPU, memory, disk I/O), implement distributed tracing, establish performance baselines, and set up end-to-end transaction monitoring

## 8. Test Monitoring System [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.4, 15.5, 15.6, 15.7
### Description: Validate the complete monitoring setup through comprehensive testing
### Details:
Conduct failure scenario testing, verify alert triggering and delivery, validate dashboard accuracy, test retry mechanisms, and document test results and system performance
