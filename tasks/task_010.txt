# Task ID: 10
# Title: Develop JSONL Dataset Builder
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 5, 6, 7
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a module to transform collected and processed data into JSONL format suitable for LLM fine-tuning.
# Details:
1. Create a `dataset_builder.py` module with DatasetBuilder class
2. Implement JSONL generation:
   - Format: `<DOM>...HTML content...</DOM><ACTION>click #selector</ACTION>`
   - Optional image format: Include `<IMAGE>s3://path/to/image.webp</IMAGE>`
3. Add filtering options:
   - By site/domain
   - By workflow type
   - By action type
   - By success/failure
4. Implement train/validation split functionality
5. Add dataset statistics generation

Example usage:
```python
from dataset_builder import DatasetBuilder

builder = DatasetBuilder()
builder.build_dataset(
    input_path="s3://checkpoints/",
    output_path="./datasets/",
    include_images=True,
    train_split=0.9
)
```

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for JSONL formatting and dataset building logic. Test with sample data to verify output format. Verify train/validation splits work correctly. Test statistics generation for accuracy.

Implement a modular design pattern following data engineering best practices. Create separate modules for each functional component with clear interfaces between them. Set up version control for tracking schema changes and code evolution.

For the JSONL Dataset Builder project, implement the following structure:

1. Source Directory Structure (src/dataset_builder/):
   - __init__.py
   - builder.py (for DatasetBuilder class)
   - config.py (for module-specific settings)
   - exceptions.py (for custom error handling)
   - types.py (for data structures like Pydantic models/TypedDicts)
   - utils.py (for utility functions)
   - formatting.py (for JSONL formatting logic)
   - filtering.py (for dataset filtering capabilities)
   - splitting.py (for train/test/validation splitting)
   - statistics.py (for dataset analytics)
   - image_handler.py (for image processing logic)

2. Test Directory Structure (tests/dataset_builder/):
   - __init__.py
   - test_builder.py
   - test_formatting.py
   - test_filtering.py
   - test_splitting.py
   - test_statistics.py
   - test_image_handler.py

3. Initial File Content:
   - Create empty __init__.py files for proper Python package structure
   - Implement basic class definition for DatasetBuilder in builder.py
   - Define custom exceptions in exceptions.py (e.g., DatasetBuilderError)
   - Add placeholder functions with type hints in other modules

This structure will support the subsequent task of implementing the JSONL formatting module (subtask 10.2) by providing the necessary scaffolding and separation of concerns.

<info added on 2025-05-14T18:55:35.150Z>
All placeholder files have been created according to the planned structure. The implementation includes:

1. Source Directory (src/dataset_builder/):
   - __init__.py: Package initialization
   - builder.py: Contains DatasetBuilder class skeleton
   - config.py: Module configuration settings
   - exceptions.py: Custom exception definitions
   - types.py: Type definitions and data structures
   - utils.py: Utility functions
   - formatting.py: JSONL formatting logic (placeholder)
   - filtering.py: Dataset filtering capabilities (placeholder)
   - splitting.py: Train/test/validation splitting (placeholder)
   - statistics.py: Dataset analytics (placeholder)
   - image_handler.py: Image processing logic (placeholder)

2. Test Directory (tests/dataset_builder/):
   - __init__.py: Test package initialization
   - test_builder.py: Tests for DatasetBuilder class
   - test_config.py: Tests for configuration module
   - test_formatting.py: Tests for JSONL formatting
   - test_filtering.py: Tests for filtering capabilities
   - test_splitting.py: Tests for dataset splitting
   - test_statistics.py: Tests for analytics functions
   - test_image_handler.py: Tests for image processing
   - test_utils.py: Tests for utility functions

Note: test_exceptions.py and test_types.py were not created at this stage as the source files contain basic definitions that don't require immediate testing.

The modular structure is now ready for implementing the JSONL formatting module (subtask 10.2) with all necessary scaffolding in place.

Develop filtering logic with configurable parameters. Implement both inclusive and exclusive filtering capabilities. Ensure the component can handle large datasets efficiently through streaming or batch processing.

The implementation has been completed with the creation of a `DataFilterer` class in `filtering.py`. This class provides methods for adding and applying various filter types including:
- URL domain filtering
- Action type filtering
- HTML content regex filtering
- Support for custom callable filters

The component is designed to work with ProcessedDataRecord objects and supports both configurable and extensible filtering capabilities. Comprehensive unit tests have been added in `test_filtering.py` that cover filter logic, filter combinations, and error handling scenarios. The filtering component is now ready for integration with the JSONL dataset builder pipeline.

The DatasetStatistics class has been implemented in statistics.py with the following key features:

1. Core statistical calculations:
   - Total record count
   - Action type distribution (frequency of each action)
   - Unique domain count
   - Domain distribution (frequency of each domain)

2. Error handling:
   - Graceful handling of empty input by returning zeroed/empty statistics
   - Custom DataStatisticsError exception added to exceptions.py for specific error cases

Create components for image loading, resizing, normalization, and augmentation. Implement efficient storage and retrieval mechanisms for image data. Ensure compatibility with common image formats and integration with the JSONL data structure.

The ImageHandler class has been implemented in src/dataset_builder/image_handler.py with the following key features:

Local image processing capabilities:
- Loading images from local paths with support for PNG, JPEG, GIF, and WEBP formats
- Resizing images with configurable dimensions
- Normalization of images (RGB conversion, pixel value scaling)
- Basic image augmentation including random flip, rotation, and color jitter
- Saving processed images to local paths in various formats with quality control

AWS S3 integration:
- Downloading images from S3 buckets
- Uploading processed images to S3
- End-to-end S3 processing pipeline (download, process locally, upload)
- Configurable S3 bucket settings
- Added boto3 and moto dependencies to requirements.txt

Error handling through custom ImageProcessingError class for graceful failure management.

A helper method get_image_reference has been implemented to retrieve image paths from ProcessedDataRecord objects, facilitating integration with the JsonlFormatter.

Comprehensive unit tests have been created in tests/dataset_builder/test_image_handler.py covering both local processing and S3 operations (using moto for mocking).

Develop unit tests for each module and integration tests for the complete pipeline. Implement data quality checks and performance benchmarks. Create automated test workflows to ensure ongoing code quality and functionality.

Integration tests for the DatasetBuilder pipeline have been implemented in `tests/dataset_builder/test_builder.py` under the new class `TestDatasetBuilderIntegration`. These tests cover:
- Basic end-to-end data flow using real components (ImageHandler, JsonlFormatter, DataFilter, DataSplitter, DatasetStatistics)
- Verification of train/validation splitting logic and output files
- Testing of filtering functionality with domain-based filters
- Correct handling of the `include_images` flag by the formatter (checking for `dataset_image_reference`) and statistics module (checking `records_with_images`)
- The `_load_processed_data` method of `DatasetBuilder` is currently patched to inject controlled test data

This integration testing significantly improves test coverage by ensuring components work together as expected within the main `build_dataset` workflow.
