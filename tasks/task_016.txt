# Task ID: 16
# Title: Develop Sample Workflow Library
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a library of sample workflows for common web interaction patterns that can be used with the orchestration system.
# Details:
1. Create a `workflows` directory with sample workflow definitions
2. Implement common workflows:
   - `youtube_video_discovery.py` - Finding and watching videos
   - `search_and_browse.py` - General search engine usage
   - `e_commerce_shopping.py` - Product browsing and cart management
   - `form_submission.py` - Filling and submitting forms
   - `social_media_browsing.py` - Timeline scrolling and interaction
3. Add documentation for each workflow
4. Create workflow composition utilities
5. Implement workflow parameterization

Example workflow:
```python
from workflow import WorkflowBuilder

YOUTUBE_VIDEO_DISCOVERY = WorkflowBuilder("youtube_video_discovery")\
    .navigate("https://youtube.com")\
    .wait_for_selector("#search")\
    .type("#search", "{{search_query}}")\
    .click("#search-icon-legacy")\
    .wait_for_selector("#video-title")\
    .click("#video-title")\
    .wait_for_selector(".ytp-play-button")\
    .build()
```

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for each workflow with mocked execution. Integration tests with actual Browserbase/Stagehand for key workflows. Test parameterization with different inputs. Verify workflows handle common error cases.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Workflow Directory Structure [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Establish a logical folder hierarchy for organizing workflows, following best practices for directory management
### Details:
Set up main directories for Development, Staging, Production, and SharedResources. Include subdirectories for individual users in Development, and specific workflow categories in Production. Create a dedicated Documentation folder.

## 2. Develop Sample Workflow Templates [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.1
### Description: Create reusable workflow templates that demonstrate common patterns and use cases
### Details:
Design at least three sample workflows covering different scenarios. Use descriptive naming conventions and ensure each workflow follows established best practices. Place these in the Templates subdirectory.

## 3. Implement Workflow Parameterization [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.2
### Description: Add configuration options to make workflows flexible and reusable across different environments
### Details:
Define input parameters, environment variables, and configuration files. Ensure workflows can be executed with different parameters without modifying the core logic. Test parameter validation and default values.

## 4. Create Composition Utilities [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.2
### Description: Develop utilities to combine and chain workflows together for complex operations
### Details:
Build helper scripts or components that enable workflow composition. Include mechanisms for data passing between workflows, error handling, and conditional execution based on workflow outputs.

## 5. Establish Testing Framework [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.3, 16.4
### Description: Set up a comprehensive testing approach for validating workflow functionality
### Details:
Implement unit tests for individual workflow components and integration tests for complete workflows. Create test data sets and validation scripts. Document the testing approach and expected outcomes.

## 6. Write Comprehensive Documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.1, 16.2, 16.3, 16.4, 16.5
### Description: Create detailed documentation for all workflows, utilities, and the overall system
### Details:
Document the directory structure, naming conventions, and workflow management practices. Include usage examples, parameter descriptions, and troubleshooting guides. Store documentation in the dedicated Documentation folder.

## 7. Implement Automation for Workflow Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.1, 16.6
### Description: Set up tools to automate routine workflow tasks and maintenance
### Details:
Configure automation tools to handle file organization, workflow deployment across environments, and routine maintenance tasks. Create scripts for moving workflows between Development, Staging, and Production environments.
