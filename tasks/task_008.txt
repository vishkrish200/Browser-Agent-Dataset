# Task ID: 8
# Title: Create Workflow Definition System
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3, 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a system for defining reusable interaction workflows that can be executed by the Stagehand Interaction Engine.
# Details:
1. Create a `workflow.py` module with Workflow class and builder pattern
2. Implement common interaction primitives:
   - Navigation (go to URL)
   - Waiting (for element, time, network)
   - Clicking (by selector, text, position)
   - Typing (into forms, with special keys)
   - Scrolling (by amount, to element)
   - Assertions (element exists, text contains)
3. Create workflow library with examples:
   - `video_discovery_v1.py` for YouTube
   - `search_workflow.py` for general search
   - `form_submission.py` for general forms
4. Add workflow validation and debugging tools

Example usage:
```python
from workflow import WorkflowBuilder

VIDEO_DISCOVERY_WORKFLOW = WorkflowBuilder("video_discovery_v1")\
    .navigate("https://youtube.com")\
    .wait_for_selector("#search")\
    .type("#search", "lofi music")\
    .click("#search-icon-legacy")\
    .wait_for_selector("#video-title")\
    .click("#video-title")\
    .wait_for_selector(".ytp-play-button")\
    .build()
```

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for workflow builder and validation. Test workflow execution with mocked Stagehand client. Create test suite with sample workflows for common interaction patterns. Verify workflows translate correctly to Stagehand tasks.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Module Setup and Architecture Design [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up the project structure and design the overall architecture for the workflow system.
### Details:
Create the initial project structure, define module interfaces, establish coding standards, and design the core architecture that will support workflow primitives and execution.

This subtask involves establishing the foundation for the Workflow Definition System by creating the initial project structure and designing the core architecture.

Key implementation details:

1. Core Responsibility:
   - Create a Pythonic interface for defining web interaction sequences
   - Generate data structures compatible with stagehand_client.create_task(payload)
   - Implement WorkflowBuilder as the central class

2. File Structure (src/workflow_system/):
   - __init__.py: Export WorkflowBuilder
   - builder.py: Implement WorkflowBuilder class
   - actions.py/primitives.py: Define constants for Stagehand action types
   - exceptions.py: Custom exception classes

3. WorkflowBuilder Class Design:
   - Constructor: Initialize with workflow name and empty steps list
   - Action Methods: Chainable methods (navigate, click, type_text, etc.)
   - Build Method: Generate final payload for stagehand_client

4. Action Dictionary Structure:
   - Each builder method will construct dictionaries matching Stagehand's expected schema
   - Example format: {"type": "action", "actionType": "click", "selector": "..."}

5. Initial Files to Create:
   - src/workflow_system/__init__.py
   - src/workflow_system/builder.py
   - src/workflow_system/exceptions.py
   - tests/workflow_system/__init__.py
   - tests/workflow_system/test_builder.py

6. StagehandClient Interface:
   - Ensure WorkflowBuilder.build() produces valid payload for stagehand_client.create_task()
   - Expected structure: {"name": str, "steps": List[Dict]}

## 2. Implement Workflow Primitives [done]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Develop the fundamental building blocks that will be used to construct workflows.
### Details:

## 3. Develop Workflow Builder Interface [done]
### Dependencies: 8.2
### Description: Create an interface for constructing and modifying workflows programmatically.
### Details:
Implement a builder pattern or similar interface that allows users to construct workflows by chaining primitive operations in a readable and maintainable way.

### Dependencies: 8.3
### Description: Develop a set of example workflows to demonstrate system capabilities.
### Details:
Build several example workflows of varying complexity to showcase the system's features and provide templates for users to adapt to their needs.

## 5. Implement Validation Tools [done]
### Dependencies: 8.2, 8.3
### Description: Create tools to validate workflow structure and identify potential issues.
### Details:
Develop validation mechanisms to check for common workflow errors such as cycles, unreachable states, and missing transitions before execution.

## 6. Build Debugging Capabilities [done]
### Dependencies: 8.3, 8.5
### Description: Implement debugging tools to help users troubleshoot workflow issues.
### Details:
Create debugging features including step-by-step execution, state inspection, breakpoints, and logging to help users identify and fix problems in their workflows.

## 7. Write Comprehensive Documentation [done]
### Dependencies: 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.5, 8.6
### Description: Create detailed documentation for all aspects of the workflow system.
### Details:
Develop user guides, API documentation, tutorials, and best practices to help users effectively utilize the workflow system and its debugging capabilities.

## 8. Implement Testing Framework [done]
### Dependencies: 8.2, 8.3, 8.6
### Description: Develop a comprehensive testing framework for workflows.
### Details:
Create unit tests, integration tests, and performance tests to ensure the reliability and efficiency of the workflow system under various conditions and use cases.
