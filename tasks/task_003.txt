# Task ID: 3
# Title: Implement Stagehand API Client
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a Python client to interface with the Stagehand API for defining and executing web interaction tasks.
# Details:
1. Create a `stagehand_client.py` module with StagehandClient class
2. Implement methods for:
   - Authentication with API keys

workflow = WorkflowBuilder("video_discovery")\
    .navigate("https://youtube.com")\
    .wait_for_selector("#video-title")\
    .click("#video-title")\
    .build()

task_id = client.create_task(workflow)
result = client.execute_task(task_id, browserbase_session_id)
```

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests with mocked API responses for all client methods. Integration test that creates and executes a simple Stagehand task. Test error handling with simulated API failures.

Set up the base directory, package manager, and configuration files. Ensure compatibility with required libraries and frameworks.

Implementation Plan for Stagehand API Client Module Setup:
1. Create main package directory: `src/stagehand_client`.
2. Inside `src/stagehand_client`, create initial Python files:
    * `__init__.py` - Package initialization
    * `client.py` - Main StagehandClient class implementation
    * `auth.py` - Authentication logic
    * `workflow.py` - Workflow definition and building utilities
    * `config.py` - Configuration settings
    * `exceptions.py` - Custom exception classes
    * `types.py` - Stagehand specific data types
    * `utils.py` - Utility functions
3. Create test directory structure: `tests/stagehand_client`.
    * Add `tests/stagehand_client/__init__.py`.

All Python files will initially be created empty or with minimal placeholder content. This structure will serve as the foundation for subsequent subtasks related to the Stagehand client, particularly the Authentication Implementation subtask that follows.

## 2. Authentication Implementation [done]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Develop authentication mechanisms to securely access APIs and resources.
### Details:
Implement token-based or OAuth authentication. Store and manage credentials securely. Integrate authentication checks into API calls.
<info added on 2025-05-11T12:00:03.141Z>
Implement an authentication system for the Stagehand API Client using the following approach:

1. Create an abstract base class `AuthStrategy` in `src/stagehand_client/auth.py` to define the authentication interface.

2. Implement the concrete `ApiKeyAuth` class that inherits from `AuthStrategy`:
   - Accept an API key in the constructor
   - Validate the API key (not empty, string type)
   - Provide a method to return authentication headers

3. Set up configuration handling in `src/stagehand_client/config.py`:
   - Define environment variable constant for the API key
   - Create a function to retrieve the API key from override parameter or environment

4. Integrate authentication in the main `StagehandClient` class:
   - Accept optional API key in constructor
   - Resolve API key using the config module
   - Create appropriate error handling for missing API keys
   - Initialize the auth strategy with the resolved key

5. Update package exports in `__init__.py` to expose the necessary classes

This implementation will provide a flexible authentication system that can be extended in the future while maintaining a clean separation of concerns between authentication, configuration, and the client itself.

<info added on 2025-05-11T12:02:05.193Z>
The authentication implementation for the Stagehand API Client has been completed with the following components:

1. Authentication Strategy:
   - Created an abstract base class `AuthStrategy` in `auth.py` that defines the interface for all authentication methods
   - Implemented the concrete `ApiKeyAuth` class that inherits from `AuthStrategy`
   - The `ApiKeyAuth` class uses the `X-Stagehand-Api-Key` header for authentication
   - Added validation to ensure API keys are valid before use

2. Configuration Management:
   - Established `config.py` with the constant `STAGEHAND_API_KEY_ENV_VAR` to define the environment variable name
   - Implemented the `get_api_key()` function that resolves API keys from either passed parameters or environment variables
   - Added proper error handling for missing or invalid API keys

3. Client Integration:
   - Integrated authentication into the main `StagehandClient` class in `client.py`
   - Implemented API key resolution logic that prioritizes constructor parameters over environment variables
   - Added a lazy-loaded `httpx.AsyncClient` instance to handle HTTP requests efficiently
   - Created a `_request` method placeholder that will be used for all authenticated API calls

4. Package Structure:
   - Updated `__init__.py` to export all relevant classes for easy importing by consumers
   - Ensured proper encapsulation of implementation details while exposing necessary interfaces

The authentication system is now ready for integration with the actual API endpoints in the next subtask. The implementation follows a flexible design that allows for future authentication methods to be added without changing the client interface.

Implement logic to execute tasks in order, handle parallelism, and manage resource allocation. Integrate with automation and integration tools if needed.

Implementation plan for the Stagehand Workflow Execution Engine:

1. Extend the StagehandClient class in src/stagehand_client/client.py to include task execution functionality:
   - Implement an async method `execute_task(task_id: str, browser_session_id: str) -> Dict[str, Any]`
   - Method will make a POST request to `/tasks/{task_id}/execute` endpoint
   - Request payload will include browser session information in format: `{"browserSessionId": browser_session_id}`
   - Method will return the API response containing execution status and results
   - Note that this is a preliminary implementation pending confirmation of the exact Stagehand API specifications

2. Additional implementation considerations:
   - Ensure proper error handling for API responses
   - Implement retry logic for failed execution attempts
   - Add logging for execution events
   - Consider implementing a status polling mechanism for long-running tasks
</info added on 2025-05-11T12:09:56.043Z>
<info added on 2025-05-11T12:10:37.617Z>
The initial implementation of the Stagehand workflow execution functionality has been completed. The `StagehandClient` class in `client.py` now includes an asynchronous method `execute_task(task_id: str, browser_session_id: str) -> Dict[str, Any]` that makes a POST request to the `/tasks/{task_id}/execute` endpoint with a payload containing the browser session ID.

This implementation provides the basic structure for triggering task execution in the Stagehand API. The method accepts a task ID and browser session ID as parameters, constructs the appropriate API request, and returns the execution response.

Next steps include:
1. Testing the implementation with actual Stagehand API endpoints
2. Adding error handling and retry logic
3. Implementing status polling for long-running tasks
4. Extending the functionality to handle task dependencies and parallel execution
5. Integrating with the broader workflow management system

Provide APIs or interfaces to access logs. Ensure logs capture relevant execution details, errors, and status updates.
<info added on 2025-05-11T12:11:30.924Z>
Provide APIs or interfaces to access logs. Ensure logs capture relevant execution details, errors, and status updates.

Implementation Plan for Log Retrieval:
1. In `src/stagehand_client/client.py` (within `StagehandClient` class):
   - Implement `async def get_task_logs(self, task_id: str) -> Dict[str, Any]` method
   - Method will fetch execution logs for a specific Stagehand task
   - Make a GET request to the endpoint `/tasks/{task_id}/logs`
   - Return a dictionary representing the API response with log entries

2. Type Definitions (Optional):
   - Consider adding `LogEntry = TypedDict` in `src/stagehand_client/types.py`
   - Define common log structure fields (timestamp, level, message)
   - Update return type of `get_task_logs` to use this type definition if implemented
   - For initial implementation, use `Dict[str, Any]` as return type

3. Error Handling:
   - Implement proper error handling for API request failures
   - Return appropriate error messages when logs cannot be retrieved

4. Testing:
   - Create unit tests to verify log retrieval functionality
   - Test with mock API responses to ensure proper parsing
</info added on 2025-05-11T12:11:30.924Z>
<info added on 2025-05-11T12:12:10.724Z>
The initial implementation of the log retrieval functionality has been completed. The `get_task_logs` method has been added to the `StagehandClient` class in `client.py`. This method accepts a task ID as a parameter and makes a GET request to the `/tasks/{task_id}/logs` endpoint to fetch the execution logs for that specific task. The method returns the API response as a dictionary containing log entries.

Next steps for log retrieval and management:
1. Enhance error handling for API request failures
2. Add proper type definitions for log entries
3. Implement pagination for large log sets
4. Add filtering capabilities (by timestamp, log level, etc.)
5. Create unit tests to verify the functionality

Additional considerations:
- Consider adding methods for workflow-level logs, not just task-level
- Evaluate options for log persistence or export functionality
- Implement log streaming for real-time monitoring

## 7. Error Handling and Logging [done]
### Dependencies: 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5
### Description: Implement robust error handling and logging throughout the module.
### Details:
Ensure all API interactions and workflow executions are wrapped with error handling. Log errors with sufficient context for debugging and auditing.
<info added on 2025-05-11T13:53:57.403Z>
Ensure all API interactions and workflow executions are wrapped with error handling. Log errors with sufficient context for debugging and auditing.

Implementation plan for error handling and logging:

1. Create exception hierarchy in `src/stagehand_client/exceptions.py`:
   - Base exception class `StagehandError(Exception)`
   - API-specific exception `StagehandAPIError(StagehandError)` with parameters:
     - message: str
     - status_code: Optional[int]
     - response_content: Optional[str]
   - Consider adding `StagehandClientError(StagehandError)` for client-side issues

2. Enhance error handling in `src/stagehand_client/client.py`:
   - In the `_request` method's exception handlers:
     - For `httpx.HTTPStatusError`: Raise `StagehandAPIError` with status code and response content
     - For `httpx.RequestError`: Raise `StagehandAPIError` with network failure information

3. Ensure comprehensive logging throughout:
   - Debug logging before requests (method, URL, payload)
   - Debug logging for successful responses (status code, response text)
   - Error logging for failed requests with detailed context
   - Verify logging provides sufficient information for debugging and auditing

4. Update `src/stagehand_client/__init__.py` to export exception classes for user access

This approach ensures consistent error handling across the client, provides detailed error information to users, and maintains comprehensive logging for troubleshooting.
